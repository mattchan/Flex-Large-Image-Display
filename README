I was tasked with displaying large images in Adobe AIR, but Flex has a max 
bitmap dimension of 2880 for display. I wrote this to get around that 
problem to display the entire image, but at lower scale. The program works by
loading an image in an HTML control (which can also be used to display CMYK
images) and then capturing chunks of pixels from the displayed HTML and copying
them into into an Image control. Each chunk of the captured HTML display is
captured by moving the HTML loader's scroll rectangle to a new area.

This is not an optimal solution since large images will use lots of memory
since I am technically rendering the image twice when it's loaded. Runtime
performance is also poor since I'm looping through "rows" and "columns" of
the image in chunks. It's an O(n^2) runtime superficially speaking.

The included image is my own which I took at the bottom of Wachusett Dam in
Massachusetts on October 10, 2011.
